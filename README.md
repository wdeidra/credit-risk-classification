# Module 20 Challenge: Credit Risk Classification

## Overview
This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to classify the credit risk of loan applications. By leveraging historical data, I will identify patterns and develop a binary classifier to predict whether a loan application should be classified as "low risk" or "high risk."

## Objectives
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Preprocess the dataset to address missing values and encode categorical features.
2. **Model Development**:
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models for binary classification.
   - Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to compare performance.
3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Analyze the models' accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Optimize the models by tuning hyperparameters.
4. **Key Insights**:
   - Provide recommendations based on the modelâ€™s predictions and performance.

## Deliverables
- Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation of machine learning models.
- Documentation of the modeling process and performance metrics.
- Insights and recommendations for credit risk assessment.
